  ## Fields

  * trigger_kind: Action that caused signature help to be triggered.
  * trigger_character: Character that caused signature help to be triggered.

    This is undefined when `triggerKind !== SignatureHelpTriggerKind.TriggerCharacter`
  * is_retrigger: `true` if signature help was already showing when it was triggered.

    Retriggers occurs when the signature help is already active and can be caused by actions such as
    typing a trigger character, a cursor move, or document content changes.
  * active_signature_help: The currently active `SignatureHelp`.

    The `activeSignatureHelp` has its `SignatureHelp.activeSignature` field updated based on
    the user navigating through available signatures.
