defmodule GenLSP.Structures.Position do
  @moduledoc """
  Position in a text document expressed as zero-based line and character
  offset. Prior to 3.17 the offsets were always based on a UTF-16 string
  representation. So a string of the form `a𐐀b` the character offset of the
  character `a` is 0, the character offset of `𐐀` is 1 and the character
  offset of b is 3 since `𐐀` is represented using two code units in UTF-16.
  Since 3.17 clients and servers can agree on a different string encoding
  representation (e.g. UTF-8). The client announces it's supported encoding
  via the client capability [`general.positionEncodings`](#clientCapabilities).
  The value is an array of position encodings the client supports, with
  decreasing preference (e.g. the encoding at index `0` is the most preferred
  one). To stay backwards compatible the only mandatory encoding is UTF-16
  represented via the string `utf-16`. The server can pick one of the
  encodings offered by the client and signals that encoding back to the
  client via the initialize result's property
  [`capabilities.positionEncoding`](#serverCapabilities). If the string value
  `utf-16` is missing from the client's capability `general.positionEncodings`
  servers can safely assume that the client supports UTF-16. If the server
  omits the position encoding in its initialize result the encoding defaults
  to the string value `utf-16`. Implementation considerations: since the
  conversion from one encoding into another requires the content of the
  file / line the conversion is best done where the file is read which is
  usually on the server side.

  Positions are line end character agnostic. So you can not specify a position
  that denotes `\r|\n` or `\n|` where `|` represents the character offset.

  @since 3.17.0 - support for negotiated position encoding.

  ## Fields

  * line: Line position in a document (zero-based).

    If a line number is greater than the number of lines in a document, it defaults back to the number of lines in the document.
    If a line number is negative, it defaults to 0.
  * character: Character offset on a line in a document (zero-based).

    The meaning of this offset is determined by the negotiated
    `PositionEncodingKind`.

    If the character value is greater than the line length it defaults back to the
    line length.
